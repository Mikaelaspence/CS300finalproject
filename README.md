# CS300finalproject

For this project, I ran into a couple issues. I worked with code from previous assignments as I had never made a CSV parser from scratch, and when I tried to use one for a previous assignment, came into some troube. I sisn't realize the top line needed to be the names of my variables as the CSV files had previously been given to us completed. Once I figured that out, I realized I was trying to input four pieces of data when they did not all have four pieces of data, so was given an error. Once I added in whether or not courses had prerequisites, I was able to get the code to work. My work on this project helped me to understand loading files in C++ better, and how to utilize a CSV parser. I also got to practice my C++ skills overall, which was a challenege for me as I have been bouncing from language to language in this program and have not felt like I have become comfortable in any language as a result. Working with more complex ideas like data structures and algorithms allowed me to work with C++ at a deeper level, and I feel I understand much more than I did going into the course.
